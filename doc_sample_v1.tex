%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Text Color}

The basic usage allows \textcolor{red}{changing the color of the font}. The script below shows the syntax.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Once loaded, the  \texttt{\textbackslash url\{www\}} command allows users to generate a working URL that explicitly shows web address in the following way: \url{https://sgpp.arizona.edu/}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Visible comments}

Create a bubble annotation at the margin of the document.\todo{Do this}

\section{Math Symbols and Equations}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{In line mathematical expression}

Generates the following sentence: I  love the binomial theorem \((x + y)^{2}\) above all!

Generates the following sentence: I  love the binomial theorem $(x + y)^{2}$ above all!

Generates the following sentence: I  love the binomial theorem \begin{math}(x + y)^{2}\end{math} above all!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Equation mode}

Generates the following equation:
\[ (x + y)^{2} \]

Generates the following equation:
$$(x + y)^{2}$$

Equation \ref{eq:bin} is the best!
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bin}
(x + y)^{2}
\end{equation}

\section{Managing citations in \LaTeX}

The seminal paper by \citet{Baggins2019} launched a new idea. Early critics remained skeptical \citep{Gamgee2018} until \citet[chap. 1]{WoodlandC2018} found new evidence.
